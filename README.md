eYRC 2023-24 unveils ‚ÄúHologlyph BotS‚Äù in which multiple robots are used for designing the Geoglyphs. 
Geoglyphs are large designs or motifs that are difficult to see or even identified on the ground but are easily appreciated when seen from the sky.
In the heart of a lush Greenland landscape, a perplexing enigma etched itself into the Earth's surface thousands of years ago. The Nasca Lines, colossal geoglyphs spanning vast stretches of green land, have confounded archaeologists and historians for centuries. These monumental creations ‚Äì intricate animal figures, geometric designs, and intricate shapes ‚Äì remain a testament to a civilization long past. Yet, their true purpose and the methods behind their construction continue to elude us.

## System Requirements:

Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Processor: eight cores, x86_64 (64-bit x86 Instruction Set)
HDD or SSD Storage space: 50GB or more
RAM: 8GB or more
Dedicated graphics card: preferable

## 1. Installation of Ubuntu and ROS 2 üõ†
 A.Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04.3&architecture=amd64)
 
 Ubuntu 22.04.03, a Linux environment is used for running all the packages and programmes such as Gazebo 11 etc.
 
 B.ROS2 Humble Installation: humble(http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)

 - A collection of software tools and libraries called the Robot Operating System (ROS) facilitates the development of robot applications.
 **Note:** Version specific middleware is rigorously enforced in ROS. Thus, ROS Noetic is utilized with Ubuntu 22.04.03 (Focal).

 C. Gazebo Installation: gazebo(https://gazebosim.org/home)

 - Gazebo 11, a physical engine (used for simulation) is tightly integrated with ROS Noetic and so it comes pre-installed when      ```ros-noetic-desktop-full```      is installed.

 D. Python(Tutorials for OOP'S),OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
 
 These tutorials are provided in the format of Jupyter Notebooks OR .ipynb files embedded in a .zip file named, python_tutorials.zip


## Tasks

For each task package, README files are provided which give details about the problem statement and the task specifications. 

- [Task 0 - Installing the required software,Solving Codechef Problems](task_0/README.md)
- [Task 1 - Task 1A(ROS2),Task 1B(Gazebo-ROS, URDF,write a simple P controller)](task_1)
- [Task 2 - Task 2A,Task 2B](task_2)
- [Task 3 - Task 3A(Bot Design),Task 3B(Arena Setup),Task 3C(Hardware Testing)](task_3)
